# Meal Printer - simple, balanced automated meal production for Rimworld's mid-to-late game!


[img=https://imgur.com/iFBTYeT.gif]

Meal Printer adds the titular meal printers. These are the spacer-tech evolution of nutrient paste dispensers, using protein resequencing and primitive molecular printing to convert raw foodstuffs into filling, wholesome meals.

# Features:



-  **The meal printer building**. Acting as an advanced drop-in upgrade to the nutrient paste dispenser, printers default to converting hoppered foodstuffs into simple meals - say goodbye to the paste mood debuff without having to chain one of your colonists to a stove! Researchable upgrades can also unlock fine meals and high-efficiency nutrient paste for printing.
-  **NutriBars**. A spacer-tech compromise between neolithic pemmican and industrial packaged survival meals, designed specifically to be mass-produced by meal printers. Lightweight, energy dense and inoffensively flavored, one NutriBar is just as filling as a traditional meal and lasts several seasons without refrigeration. Once unlocked via research project, your printers can produce these in bulk - great for emergency supplies or provisioning caravans.



# Details:



-  Meal printers are unlocked through the Meal Printing research project, which requires Nutrient Paste and Fabrication research.
-  A meal printer costs 75 plasteel, 25 steel and 3 advanced components. Once built, it requires 1000W of power, and functions as a drop-in paste dispenser upgrade.
-  A printer's desired output meal can be set on its toolbar. To start only simple meals are available; more options can be unlocked through research.


- **Simple meals** have no exceptional benefits or downsides. They print with identical nutrient efficiency to cooking them manually.
- **Fine meals** will give a mood buff, but have a disgustingly poor print efficiency - equivalent to lavish meals. 
- **High-efficiency nutrient paste** will consume even less raw food per meal than a paste dispenser, but you'll have to deal with the paste meal mood debuff.


-  Colonists will not use a printer if its set meal type is forbidden by their food policy.
-  Once researched, NutriBars can be printed in bulk from a printer's toolbar. You can print up to 30 in one go, and each bar costs the same amount of nutrition as a simple meal - 0.5, or 10 units of most foodstuffs like rice. Bars last 75 days without refrigeration and are just as filling as a normal meal.



# FAQ:



-  ***"Isn't this a lot like https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1715402900]Replimat?"*** Yes! I even used some code from Replimat to ease the process of patching the printer into the game's existing nutrient paste workflow. However, Replimat is a great mod, but it's balanced heavily towards the very "I don't wanna leave the planet" end game of Rimworld. Meal Printer is a cheaper and simpler alternative for Rimworld's mid-to-late game.
-  ***"Why add NutriBars instead of just using packaged survival meals?"*** Primarily because PSMs have a market value of $24, meaning it'd be *very* easy to churn them out as silver fodder if you could just print them. I could have gone with pemmican, but I wanted something that was "one unit = one meal," so I met in the middle and made NutriBars. (They have a market value of $5, if you were wondering.)



# Known issues:



- **CURRENTLY NOT COMPATIBLE WITH https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2426119067]Animal Controls. Nothing I can do about this AFAIK, only the author can fix his patch.**
- When looking for a meal, colonists may rarely pick raw food over using the printer. This appears to either be a vanilla bug with food dispensers or a third-party mod conflict, since the same problem happens with regular paste dispensers w/o this mod installed. Forbidding raw food in your colonist's food policies will prevent it, but there's nothing I can do to fix it.



# Other stuff:



-  Meal Printer should be safe to add to an existing save. You can also remove it mid-save, but deconstruct any printers and get rid of any NutriBars first.
-  Don't hesitate to leave a comment if you run into a bug, but PLEASE include any relevant information from the debug log if you do so.

-  **If you enjoy Meal Printer, be sure to give it a favorite and a thumbs-up so the Workshop algorithm gives it some time in the limelight!**
